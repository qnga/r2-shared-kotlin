     * - If the original file has a media type that can't be recognized by parsers,

     * @property fetcher Primary leaf fetcher to be used by parsers.
     * The Content Protection can unlock resources by modifying the Fetcher provided to ContentProtection::open(),
     * for example by:
     * - Wrapping the given fetcher in a TransformingFetcher with a decryption Resource.Transformer function.
     * - Discarding the provided fetcher altogether and creating a new one to handle access restrictions.
     *   For example, by creating an HTTPFetcher which will inject a Bearer Token in requests.
     *
     * @property protectionServiceFactory Factory for the Content Protection Publication Service
     * that will be added to the created Publication by the Streamer.
